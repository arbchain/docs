## Contracts

The smart contracts are currently under closed development. The recent release of contracts are deployed to http://testnet.arbchain.xyz 
and the artifacts can be found in the client [repo](https://github.com/arbchain/web).

:::note
You can setup your own network with privacy nodes using this [Quorum quick start guide](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart) and deploy the arbchain contracts on your own. Reach out to us at arbchain@consensolabs.com for the
contract artifacts and guidance on deployment.
